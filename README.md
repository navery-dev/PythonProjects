# Python Projects

This repository contains Python projects based on "The Big Book of Small Python Projects" by Al Sweigart with my own updates, modifications, and improvements to practice coding skills and make the code my own.

## About This Repository

Each project starts with the base code from "The Big Book of Small Python Projects" and includes my own modifications to:
- Practice Python programming concepts
- Experiment with different game mechanics
- Improve user experience and interface
- Add new features and functionality

## Running the Projects

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed, then run any project with:
```bash
python project_name.py
```

Python modules needed for some of the projects can be installed with the below:
```python
>>> import os, sys
>>> os.system(sys.executable + ' -m pip install --user bigbookpython')
```
